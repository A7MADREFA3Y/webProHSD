            When a person sits at a computer and codes with full concentration, losing track of time and feeling effortlessly productive, <br />
            this is called being in the flow state (often referred to as the coding flow or programmer’s flow).<br /><br /><br />
            What Flow State Means<br /><br />
            The flow state, described by psychologist <strong>Mihály Csíkszentmihályi</strong>, is a mental condition of complete immersion in an activity.<br />
            During flow, a person is fully focused, their actions feel natural, and time seems to pass quickly.<br />
            This phenomenon can occur in sports, art, or intellectual work like software development. veryLongWord<wbr>ToTest<wbr>THEBreackline
