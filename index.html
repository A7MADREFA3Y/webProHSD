    <h2>What is actually flow coding?</h2>

    <h4>When a person sits at a computer and codes with full concentration, losing track of time and feeling effortlessly productive, <br>
      this is called being in the flow state (often referred to as the coding flow or programmer’s flow).<br><br><br>

      What Flow State Means<br><br>

      The flow state, described by psychologist <Strong> Mihály Csíkszentmihályi </Strong>, is a mental condition of complete immersion in an activity.<br>
      During flow, a person is fully focused, their actions feel natural, and time seems to pass quickly.<br>
      This phenomenon can occur in sports, art, or intellectual work like software development.
